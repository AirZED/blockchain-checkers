Here's my analysis of the two approaches for submitting game results in the blockchain-checkers tournament:

Winner submits result: 
Pros:
Direct player involvement
Decentralized approach
No need for backend key management

Cons:
Can be manipulated if winner lies
Doesn't handle draws
Other player has no say in the result
Potential for disputes



Game account submits result (current implementation): 

Pros:
Trusted neutral party submits results
Can handle all game outcomes (wins, losses, draws)
Server validates game state before submission
Prevents player manipulation
Single source of truth
Can enforce game rules properly
Can handle disconnections/timeouts

Cons:
Requires secure backend key management
More centralized approach



The game account approach (current implementation) is the better choice because:
The server already has the full game state
Can validate moves and outcomes
Handles all edge cases
Prevents cheating
Provides definitive results
Matches the existing socket-based game architecture
The server-side validation with a dedicated game account provides the most reliable and cheat-proof way to submit tournament results to the blockchain.
